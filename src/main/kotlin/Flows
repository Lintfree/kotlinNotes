Thinking about Flows
You could think of a Flow like a conveyor belt inside a factory, and each item transported by the said belt as a piece of data, for example:

Letâ€™s say that we are creating a Video Game Weapon storage facility. Each Weapon is produced at random and in real time.
We want to store each Weapon the moment it is produced
