/*
String Templates
The full syntax for a string template is ${your-expression-here}
Inside the curly braces you can write any expression you want.
Line breaks, comments, if/else expressions and when expressions are all allowed.
If you are only reading a variable you can omit the braces.

Escaping quotation marks:
If you want to put quotation marks inside a string literal use an escape character.
"Madrigal proclaims, "Hello world!"" would only print Madrigal proclaims,
Use an escape character to let the compiler know to treat it as text and not syntax.
The \ character accomplishes this
Other escape characters include:
\t  insert tab
\b backspace
\n newline
\r carriage return
\" double quotation marks
\' single quotation marks or apostrophe
\\ backslash
\$ dollar sign
\u unicode char
