/* Objects and their properties
	Every time when you work with variables, you work with objects.
	For example, an integer 5 and a string "love" are objects.

	A simple example of an object is a String that stores a message.
	a message has a state: it contains not only a sequence of symbols but also the size of the sequence.
	something that allows you to access the state of an object is called a property.

	In Kotlin, something that allows you to access the state of an object is called a property.
	Just put a dot and write the name of the property after the object, and you will get what you want
	ie: .length
	or a function ie: .toUpperCase() .repeat

	 An object can be either mutable or immutable.
