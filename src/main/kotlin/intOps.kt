    Double can represent a wider number range than Float.
    Double  range is 4.9E-324 to 1.7976931348623157E308;
    Float range is 1.4E-45 to 3.4028235E38.
    You can use the .toDouble() function to convert a Float into a Double.
    In practice, programmers mostly use the Double type.
    Double is the default type for numeric values in Kotlin.
    You can also use it to represent non-numeric values, such as the pi constant:
    val pi = 3.1415
    val squaredPi = pi * pi

    For fractional operands, the operator / performs division with a remainder, not integer division.
    println(squaredPi / 2) // prints 4.934511125

    Errors during computation
    Be careful â€” operations with floating-point numbers can produce an inaccurate result:

    You can use readln() to read Doubles and Floats from the standard input:
    val f = readln().toFloat()  // Float
    val d = readln().toDouble() // Double

     a program that calculates a triangle area. To find it, the program reads the base and the height from the standard input, then multiplies them and divides the result by 2. Note that the base and the height are perpendicular to each other.

    fun main() {
        val base = readln().toDouble()
        val height = readln().toDouble()

        val area = (base * height) / 2

        println(area)
    }

    Decimal separator
    It is crucial to use the correct decimal separator.
    The separator is locale-dependent, such as a dot for the US locale.
    If you happen to employ any other character, it may crash your program.
    If you work with another locale and want to use the dot character, you can use this construction:

    import java.util.Locale

    val floatNum = readln().format(Locale.US).toFloat()


    fun main() {
        val miles = readLine()!!.toDouble()
        val time = readLine()!!.toDouble()

        println(miles / time)
    }


    import kotlin.math.pow

    fun main() {
	    val x = readln().toDouble()

	    println(x.pow(3.0) + x.pow(2.0) + x + 1.0)
    }
     */
